            <br>Mid-2021, after leaving her motherland, England, and landing in New York City Liz began her coding journey...
            <br>A former Music Tech student and avid MySpace page editor in the early 00's, she rekindled her love for making computers do stuff by following free tutorials, and talking to friends in the field.
            As a person who can't rest until a problem is solved, it's a miracle she didn't discover this path sooner.
