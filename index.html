        <p id="intro" class="blocktext">
            <br>Mid-2021, after leaving her motherland of England, and landing in New York City Liz began her coding journey. A former Music Tech student and avid MySpace layout editor in the early 00's, she rekindled her love for "making computers do stuff" by following free tutorials, and talking to friends in the field.
            As a person who can't rest until a problem is solved, it's a miracle she didn't discover this path sooner. Currently enrolled in Flatiron's prestigious Software Engineering bootcamp, she is ready to break into tech.
