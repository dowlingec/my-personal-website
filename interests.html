    <h2>Travel</h2>
    <p id="bulkText">Liz has done her fair share of travel, but as I'm sure many fellow explorers will agree it's never enough. Before moving to the states she did a whistlestop tour of six European countries, starting in Italy exploring Rome, stopping at the Trevi Fountain mostly for the Lizzie McGuire Movie throwback, doing her best mountain goat impression in Budapest (trust me, Google it), scoffing marzipan in Vienna, throwing down at a punk show in Berlin and winding down in Amsterdam with just a backpack for company.
